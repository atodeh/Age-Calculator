# Age-Calculator

A simple program that I decided to make while learning JavaScript. It takes birth information(day/month/year) along with target information(day/month/year) as user input. The program will then output, based on the given information, the age in years, months, and days.

The program will only accept valid input, and will keep prompting the user if invalid information is given.

As a note, the target information is typically today's present date, and this is what the various prompts in the program will ask the user for. However, any date can be entered to find out a past or future age based on a specific date if the user chooses.
